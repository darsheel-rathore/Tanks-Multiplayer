# Tanks Multiplayer 1v1

Welcome to the repository for **Tanks Multiplayer 1v1**, an exhilarating online multiplayer top-down 1v1 tank shooting game. This project is a creative expansion of Unity's official Tanks! Tutorial, transforming it into a networked multiplayer experience that pits players against each other over a network connection. The game retains its captivating low-poly desert-themed graphics and utilizes Photon Unity Networking (PUN) to manage its network aspects.

## Overview

**Tanks Multiplayer 1v1** takes the foundation of the Unity Tanks! Tutorial and elevates it into an engaging online experience. While the original tutorial facilitated local 1v1 gameplay on the same device, this version enables 1v1 battles between players from different devices over the network. The game features a desert-themed map, immersive low-poly graphics, and exciting tank combat.

In this game, two players can join a room and compete against each other in a 3-round match. The player who wins 3 rounds first emerges victorious.
